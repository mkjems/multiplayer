# TODO
## Sprint 38 Prepare landing page for parallax background effect
 
      

## Backlog 
- The arena should have a background of tiles the 
- Show the ammo under the character.
- Show a list of names of the players currently in the lobby.
- When you get low energy (<20%) you should start to move more slowly and the speed should decrease as you loose more energy. But even if you have 0% you should still be able to move very slowly.
- Integrate chatGPT API to do experiments.
- Switch to a sprite for the player character


## Boring Bugs
- Why is there a lag when you are moving the character with the keyboard?
- Performance bug: Stale game_over timeout may fire after a room resets.
  - Store pending game_over timeout ids per room.
  - Cancel them when a room becomes empty or restarts.
  - Verify new players cannot receive an old winner message.
- Bug. When you have added the Progressive Web App to the home screen and you are playing a game. 
    If the phone goes to sleep/energy saving mode ( black screen ) and you wakes up again, then  the server connection is not restored and the player can not move. only move the arm will move
- When all players are dead everyone should return to the lobby. (If a sole player shoot him or her self)
- Gun should also be part of collision geometry. Mussel should not poke through rock/cacti.
- In game. For some reason the sound for the first shot is lagging way more than the following shots

## Ideas / Maybes  
- Have a random Tank that passes through the arena and shoots like a crazy person 
- Health pills that can be found that restore player health
- Steroids pills that can be found that give more energy for a period of time.
- Make it easier to change the name of your character

- Make it possible to draw your own character. Allow upload of an image of a child's drawing, send the drawing to chatGPT and ask it to make a sprite sheet from it.
    post process the sprites to make sure it is transparent and the right size. Then use that sprite for the character.
    Created sprites should be saved for reuse.
- Make it possible to type messages to other players while playing. text should appear in small cartoon like bubbles above the character.
- Option to not shoot bullets but instead shoot hearts that heal those hit.  

- First sound is always a bit lagging. Can we fix that? Sound we have a short game intro melody?
- Cacti should have one or two arms and variation in height
- Use real sounds for effects 
- Make overlay where user can read about the controls of the game.
- Should we have a walking sound?
- When new players join character should be placed as far away for the other players as possible but 30px from the edge 

- Make the diagnostics graphs bigger and have lines and numbers on the x and y axis.   

- Do we need a router for our server or is it more performant without one?
